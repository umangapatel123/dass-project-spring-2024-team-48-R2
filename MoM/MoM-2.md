- Got clarity on project requirements.

- Goal is to have an EC2 instance serving requests to an 'x' use-case, here it is a rudimentary chatbot.

- This EC2 instance must concurrently warm a lambda and service the first request.

- Subsequent requests must be directed to corresponding warm lambda.

- In addition, Data Visualisation is required to identify resources used, and costs involved
